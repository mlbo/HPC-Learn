The top level Flux system instance on LC systems is configured to store information about completed jobs in a database. This allows us to track usage by users and banks and assign job priorities based on that usage and the bank's allocation. In this section, we will discuss the commands for querying information about completed jobs, usage, and job priority.

*Coming soon*
