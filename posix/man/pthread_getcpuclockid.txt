NAME
       pthread_getcpuclockid  - access a thread CPU-time clock (ADVANCED REAL-
       TIME THREADS)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>
       #include <time.h>

       int pthread_getcpuclockid(pthread_t thread_id, clockid_t *clock_id);


DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_getcpuclockid() function shall return in clock_id the clock
       ID  of  the CPU-time clock of the thread specified by thread_id, if the
       thread specified by thread_id exists.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, pthread_getcpuclockid() shall return  zero;
       otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The pthread_getcpuclockid() function may fail if:

       ESRCH  The  value  specified by thread_id does not refer to an existing
              thread.


       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES

APPLICATION USAGE
       The pthread_getcpuclockid() function is part  of  the  Thread  CPU-Time
       Clocks option and need not be provided on all implementations.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
