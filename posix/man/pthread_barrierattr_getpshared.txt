NAME
       pthread_barrierattr_getpshared,  pthread_barrierattr_setpshared  -  get
       and set the process-shared attribute of the barrier  attributes  object
       (ADVANCED REALTIME THREADS)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>



       int pthread_barrierattr_getpshared(const pthread_barrierattr_t *
              restrict attr, int *restrict pshared);
       int pthread_barrierattr_setpshared(pthread_barrierattr_t *attr,
              int pshared);


DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_barrierattr_getpshared() function shall obtain the value of
       the process-shared attribute from the attributes object  referenced  by
       attr.  The pthread_barrierattr_setpshared() function shall set the pro-
       cess-shared attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by
       attr.

       The process-shared attribute is set to PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED to permit
       a barrier to be operated upon by any thread that has access to the mem-
       ory  where the barrier is allocated. If the process-shared attribute is
       PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE, the barrier shall only  be  operated  upon  by
       threads  created within the same process as the thread that initialized
       the barrier; if threads of different processes attempt  to  operate  on
       such  a  barrier,  the  behavior is undefined. The default value of the
       attribute shall be PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE. Both constants PTHREAD_PRO-
       CESS_SHARED and PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE are defined in <pthread.h>.

       Additional attributes, their default values, and the names of the asso-
       ciated functions to get and set those attribute values are  implementa-
       tion-defined.

RETURN VALUE
       If  successful,  the  pthread_barrierattr_getpshared()  function  shall
       return zero and store the value of the process-shared attribute of attr
       into  the  object  referenced  by  the pshared parameter. Otherwise, an
       error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

       If  successful,  the  pthread_barrierattr_setpshared()  function  shall
       return  zero;  otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate
       the error.

ERRORS
       These functions may fail if:

       EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.


       The pthread_barrierattr_setpshared() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The new value specified for the process-shared attribute is  not
              one  of  the legal values PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED or PTHREAD_PRO-
              CESS_PRIVATE.


       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

APPLICATION USAGE
       The  pthread_barrierattr_getpshared()   and   pthread_barrierattr_setp-
       shared() functions are part of the Barriers option and need not be pro-
       vided on all implementations.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
