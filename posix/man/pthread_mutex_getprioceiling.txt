NAME
       pthread_mutex_getprioceiling,  pthread_mutex_setprioceiling  -  get and
       set the priority ceiling of a mutex (REALTIME THREADS)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_mutex_getprioceiling(const pthread_mutex_t *restrict mutex,
              int *restrict prioceiling);
       int pthread_mutex_setprioceiling(pthread_mutex_t *restrict mutex,
              int prioceiling, int *restrict old_ceiling);


DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_mutex_getprioceiling()  function  shall return the current
       priority ceiling of the mutex.

       The pthread_mutex_setprioceiling() function shall either lock the mutex
       if  it  is unlocked, or block until it can successfully lock the mutex,
       then it shall change the  mutex's  priority  ceiling  and  release  the
       mutex.  When the change is successful, the previous value of the prior-
       ity ceiling shall be returned in old_ceiling. The  process  of  locking
       the mutex need not adhere to the priority protect protocol.

       If  the pthread_mutex_setprioceiling() function fails, the mutex prior-
       ity ceiling shall not be changed.

RETURN VALUE
       If     successful,     the      pthread_mutex_getprioceiling()      and
       pthread_mutex_setprioceiling()  functions shall return zero; otherwise,
       an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The pthread_mutex_getprioceiling()  and  pthread_mutex_setprioceiling()
       functions may fail if:

       EINVAL The priority requested by prioceiling is out of range.

       EINVAL The  value  specified  by  mutex  does  not refer to a currently
              existing mutex.

       EPERM  The caller does not have the privilege to perform the operation.


       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].
