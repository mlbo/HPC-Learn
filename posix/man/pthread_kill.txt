PTHREAD_KILL(P)            POSIX Programmer's Manual           PTHREAD_KILL(P)



NAME
       pthread_kill - send a signal to a thread

SYNOPSIS
       #include <signal.h>

       int pthread_kill(pthread_t thread, int sig);


DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_kill() function shall request that a signal be delivered to
       the specified thread.

       As in kill(), if sig is zero, error checking shall be performed but  no
       signal shall actually be sent.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful completion, the function shall return a value of zero.
       Otherwise,  the  function  shall  return  an  error  number.   If   the
       pthread_kill() function fails, no signal shall be sent.

ERRORS
       The pthread_kill() function shall fail if:

       ESRCH  No  thread could be found corresponding to that specified by the
              given thread ID.

       EINVAL The value of the sig argument is an invalid or unsupported  sig-
              nal number.


       The  pthread_kill() function shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The pthread_kill() function provides  a  mechanism  for  asynchronously
       directing  a  signal  at a thread in the calling process. This could be
       used, for example, by one thread to affect broadcast delivery of a sig-
       nal to a set of threads.

       Note  that  pthread_kill()  only causes the signal to be handled in the
       context of the given thread; the signal action  (termination  or  stop-
       ping) affects the process as a whole.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
