PTHREAD_ATTR_GETSCOPE(P)   POSIX Programmer's Manual  PTHREAD_ATTR_GETSCOPE(P)



NAME
       pthread_attr_getscope,  pthread_attr_setscope  -  get  and set the con-
       tentionscope attribute (REALTIME THREADS)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_attr_getscope(const pthread_attr_t *restrict attr,
              int *restrict contentionscope);
       int pthread_attr_setscope(pthread_attr_t *attr, int contentionscope);


DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_attr_getscope()  and  pthread_attr_setscope()   functions,
       respectively,  shall  get  and set the contentionscope attribute in the
       attr object.

       The contentionscope attribute may have the values PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM,
       signifying  system  scheduling  contention scope, or PTHREAD_SCOPE_PRO-
       CESS, signifying process  scheduling  contention  scope.   The  symbols
       PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM  and  PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS  are  defined  in  the
       <pthread.h> header.

RETURN VALUE
       If successful, the pthread_attr_getscope() and  pthread_attr_setscope()
       functions  shall  return  zero;  otherwise,  an  error  number shall be
       returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The pthread_attr_setscope() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The value of contentionscope is not valid.

       ENOTSUP
              An attempt was made to  set  the  attribute  to  an  unsupported
              value.


       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       After  these attributes have been set, a thread can be created with the
       specified attributes using pthread_create(). Using these routines  does
       not affect the current running thread.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
