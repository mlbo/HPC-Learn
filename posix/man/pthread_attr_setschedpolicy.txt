NAME
       pthread_attr_getschedpolicy,  pthread_attr_setschedpolicy - get and set
       the schedpolicy attribute (REALTIME THREADS)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_attr_getschedpolicy(const pthread_attr_t *restrict attr,
              int *restrict policy);
       int pthread_attr_setschedpolicy(pthread_attr_t *attr, int policy);


DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_attr_getschedpolicy()  and   pthread_attr_setschedpolicy()
       functions, respectively, shall get and set the schedpolicy attribute in
       the attr argument.

       The supported values of policy shall include SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR,  and
       SCHED_OTHER,  which  are defined in the <sched.h> header.  When threads
       executing  with  the  scheduling  policy  SCHED_FIFO,  SCHED_RR,     or
       SCHED_SPORADIC  are waiting on a mutex, they shall acquire the mutex in
       priority order when the mutex is unlocked.

RETURN VALUE
       If     successful,      the      pthread_attr_getschedpolicy()      and
       pthread_attr_setschedpolicy()  functions  shall return zero; otherwise,
       an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The pthread_attr_setschedpolicy() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The value of policy is not valid.

       ENOTSUP
              An attempt was made to  set  the  attribute  to  an  unsupported
              value.


       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       After  these attributes have been set, a thread can be created with the
       specified attributes using pthread_create(). Using these routines  does
       not affect the current running thread.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
