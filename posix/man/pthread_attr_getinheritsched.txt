NAME
       pthread_attr_getinheritsched,  pthread_attr_setinheritsched  -  get and
       set the inheritsched attribute (REALTIME THREADS)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_attr_getinheritsched(const pthread_attr_t *restrict attr,
              int *restrict inheritsched);
       int pthread_attr_setinheritsched(pthread_attr_t *attr,
              int inheritsched);


DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_attr_getinheritsched(), and  pthread_attr_setinheritsched()
       functions,  respectively,  shall get and set the inheritsched attribute
       in the attr argument.

       When the attributes objects are used by  pthread_create(),  the  inher-
       itsched attribute determines how the other scheduling attributes of the
       created thread shall be set.

       PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED

              Specifies that the thread scheduling attributes shall be  inher-
              ited  from the creating thread, and the scheduling attributes in
              this attr argument shall be ignored.

       PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED

              Specifies that the thread scheduling attributes shall be set  to
              the corresponding values from this attributes object.


       The   symbols   PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED  and  PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED  are
       defined in the <pthread.h> header.

       The    following    thread    scheduling    attributes    defined    by
       IEEE Std 1003.1-2001   are  affected  by  the  inheritsched  attribute:
       scheduling policy ( schedpolicy), scheduling parameters (  schedparam),
       and scheduling contention scope ( contentionscope).

RETURN VALUE
       If successful, the pthread_attr_getinheritsched() and pthread_attr_set-
       inheritsched() functions shall return zero; otherwise, an error  number
       shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The pthread_attr_setinheritsched() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The value of inheritsched is not valid.

       ENOTSUP
              An  attempt  was  made  to  set  the attribute to an unsupported
              value.


       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       After these attributes have been set, a thread can be created with  the
       specified  attributes using pthread_create(). Using these routines does
       not affect the current running thread.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
