PTHREAD_RWLOCKATTR_DESTROY(POSIX Programmer's ManPTHREAD_RWLOCKATTR_DESTROY(P)



NAME
       pthread_rwlockattr_destroy,  pthread_rwlockattr_init - destroy and ini-
       tialize the read-write lock attributes object

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_rwlockattr_destroy(pthread_rwlockattr_t *attr);
       int pthread_rwlockattr_init(pthread_rwlockattr_t *attr);


DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_rwlockattr_destroy() function shall  destroy  a  read-write
       lock  attributes  object.  A  destroyed  attr  attributes object can be
       reinitialized using pthread_rwlockattr_init(); the results of otherwise
       referencing  the  object  after it has been destroyed are undefined. An
       implementation may cause pthread_rwlockattr_destroy() to set the object
       referenced by attr to an invalid value.

       The  pthread_rwlockattr_init()  function  shall initialize a read-write
       lock attributes object attr with the  default  value  for  all  of  the
       attributes defined by the implementation.

       Results are undefined if pthread_rwlockattr_init() is called specifying
       an already initialized attr attributes object.

       After a read-write lock attributes object has been used  to  initialize
       one  or  more  read-write  locks, any function affecting the attributes
       object (including destruction) shall not affect any previously initial-
       ized read-write locks.

RETURN VALUE
       If  successful,  the  pthread_rwlockattr_destroy()  and pthread_rwlock-
       attr_init() functions shall return zero;  otherwise,  an  error  number
       shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The pthread_rwlockattr_destroy() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.


       The pthread_rwlockattr_init() function shall fail if:

       ENOMEM Insufficient  memory  exists  to  initialize the read-write lock
              attributes object.


       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].
