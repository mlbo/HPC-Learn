PTHREAD_SPIN_UNLOCK(P)     POSIX Programmer's Manual    PTHREAD_SPIN_UNLOCK(P)



NAME
       pthread_spin_unlock  -  unlock  a  spin  lock object (ADVANCED REALTIME
       THREADS)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_spin_unlock(pthread_spinlock_t *lock);


DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_spin_unlock() function shall release the spin  lock  refer-
       enced   by  lock  which  was  locked  via  the  pthread_spin_lock()  or
       pthread_spin_trylock() functions. The results are undefined if the lock
       is not held by the calling thread. If there are threads spinning on the
       lock when pthread_spin_unlock() is called, the lock  becomes  available
       and an unspecified spinning thread shall acquire the lock.

       The results are undefined if this function is called with an uninitial-
       ized thread spin lock.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, the  pthread_spin_unlock()  function  shall
       return  zero;  otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate
       the error.

ERRORS
       The pthread_spin_unlock() function may fail if:

       EINVAL An invalid argument was specified.

       EPERM  The calling thread does not hold the lock.


       This function shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

       need not be provided on all implementations.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
