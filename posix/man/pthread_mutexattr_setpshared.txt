NAME
       pthread_mutexattr_getpshared,  pthread_mutexattr_setpshared  -  get and
       set the process-shared attribute

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_mutexattr_getpshared(const pthread_mutexattr_t *
              restrict attr, int *restrict pshared);
       int pthread_mutexattr_setpshared(pthread_mutexattr_t *attr,
              int pshared);


DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_mutexattr_getpshared() function shall obtain the  value  of
       the  process-shared  attribute from the attributes object referenced by
       attr. The pthread_mutexattr_setpshared() function shall  set  the  pro-
       cess-shared attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by
       attr.

       The process-shared attribute is set to PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED to permit
       a mutex to be operated upon by any thread that has access to the memory
       where the mutex is allocated, even if the mutex is allocated in  memory
       that  is  shared by multiple processes. If the process-shared attribute
       is PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE, the mutex shall only be  operated  upon  by
       threads  created within the same process as the thread that initialized
       the mutex; if threads of differing processes attempt to operate on such
       a  mutex, the behavior is undefined. The default value of the attribute
       shall be PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, pthread_mutexattr_setpshared() shall return
       zero;  otherwise,  an  error  number  shall be returned to indicate the
       error.

       Upon successful completion, pthread_mutexattr_getpshared() shall return
       zero  and  store the value of the process-shared attribute of attr into
       the object referenced by the pshared  parameter.  Otherwise,  an  error
       number shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The  pthread_mutexattr_getpshared()  and pthread_mutexattr_setpshared()
       functions may fail if:

       EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.


       The pthread_mutexattr_setpshared() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The new value specified for the attribute is outside  the  range
              of legal values for that attribute.


       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].
