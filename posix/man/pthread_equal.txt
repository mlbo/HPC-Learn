PTHREAD_EQUAL(P)           POSIX Programmer's Manual          PTHREAD_EQUAL(P)



NAME
       pthread_equal - compare thread IDs

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_equal(pthread_t t1, pthread_t t2);


DESCRIPTION
       This function shall compare the thread IDs t1 and t2.

RETURN VALUE
       The pthread_equal() function shall return a non-zero value if t1 and t2
       are equal; otherwise, zero shall be returned.

       If either t1 or t2 are not valid thread IDs, the behavior is undefined.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The pthread_equal() function shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       Implementations may choose to define a thread ID as a  structure.  This
       allows  additional  flexibility  and  robustness over using an int. For
       example, a thread ID could include a sequence number that allows detec-
       tion  of "dangling IDs" (copies of a thread ID that has been detached).
       Since the C language does not support comparison  on  structure  types,
       the pthread_equal() function is provided to compare thread IDs.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
