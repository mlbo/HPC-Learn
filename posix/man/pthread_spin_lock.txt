PTHREAD_SPIN_LOCK(P)       POSIX Programmer's Manual      PTHREAD_SPIN_LOCK(P)



NAME
       pthread_spin_lock,  pthread_spin_trylock  -  lock  a  spin  lock object
       (ADVANCED REALTIME THREADS)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_spin_lock(pthread_spinlock_t *lock);
       int pthread_spin_trylock(pthread_spinlock_t *lock);


DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_spin_lock() function shall lock the spin lock referenced by
       lock.  The  calling  thread shall acquire the lock if it is not held by
       another thread. Otherwise, the thread shall spin (that  is,  shall  not
       return from the pthread_spin_lock() call) until the lock becomes avail-
       able.  The results are undefined if the calling thread holds  the  lock
       at the time the call is made. The pthread_spin_trylock() function shall
       lock the spin lock referenced by lock if it is not held by any  thread.
       Otherwise, the function shall fail.

       The  results  are undefined if any of these functions is called with an
       uninitialized spin lock.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return  zero;  other-
       wise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       These functions may fail if:

       EINVAL The  value  specified  by  lock does not refer to an initialized
              spin lock object.


       The pthread_spin_lock() function may fail if:

       EDEADLK
              The calling thread already holds the lock.


       The pthread_spin_trylock() function shall fail if:

       EBUSY  A thread currently holds the lock.


       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       Applications using this function may be subject to priority  inversion,
       as  discussed  in  the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
       Section 3.285, Priority Inversion.

       The pthread_spin_lock() and pthread_spin_trylock() functions  are  part
       of  the  Spin  Locks option and need not be provided on all implementa-
       tions.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
