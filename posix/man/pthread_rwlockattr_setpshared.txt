PTHREAD_RWLOCKATTR_GETPSHARPOSIX Programmer's PTHREAD_RWLOCKATTR_GETPSHARED(P)



NAME
       pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared,  pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared - get and
       set the process-shared attribute  of  the  read-write  lock  attributes
       object

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared(const pthread_rwlockattr_t *
              restrict attr, int *restrict pshared);
       int pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared(pthread_rwlockattr_t *attr,
              int pshared);


DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared() function shall obtain the value of
       the process-shared attribute from  the  initialized  attributes  object
       referenced  by attr. The pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared() function shall
       set the process-shared attribute in an  initialized  attributes  object
       referenced by attr.

       The  process-shared attribute shall be set to PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED to
       permit a read-write lock to be operated upon by  any  thread  that  has
       access  to  the  memory where the read-write lock is allocated, even if
       the read-write lock is allocated in memory that is shared  by  multiple
       processes.  If the process-shared attribute is PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE,
       the read-write lock shall only be  operated  upon  by  threads  created
       within  the  same process as the thread that initialized the read-write
       lock; if threads of differing processes attempt to operate  on  such  a
       read-write  lock,  the  behavior is undefined. The default value of the
       process-shared attribute shall be PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE.

       Additional attributes, their default values, and the names of the asso-
       ciated  functions to get and set those attribute values are implementa-
       tion-defined.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, the  pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared()  func-
       tion  shall  return  zero  and  store  the  value of the process-shared
       attribute of attr into the object referenced by the pshared  parameter.
       Otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

       If   successful,  the  pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared()  function  shall
       return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned  to  indicate
       the error.

ERRORS
       The pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared() and pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared()
       functions may fail if:

       EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.


       The pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The new value specified for the attribute is outside  the  range
              of legal values for that attribute.


       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].
