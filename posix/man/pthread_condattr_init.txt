NAME
       pthread_condattr_destroy,  pthread_condattr_init - destroy and initial-
       ize the condition variable attributes object

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_condattr_destroy(pthread_condattr_t *attr);
       int pthread_condattr_init(pthread_condattr_t *attr);


DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_condattr_destroy() function shall destroy a condition vari-
       able  attributes  object; the object becomes, in effect, uninitialized.
       An implementation  may  cause  pthread_condattr_destroy()  to  set  the
       object  referenced  by  attr  to  an  invalid  value.  A destroyed attr
       attributes object can be reinitialized  using  pthread_condattr_init();
       the  results  of  otherwise  referencing  the  object after it has been
       destroyed are undefined.

       The pthread_condattr_init() function shall initialize a condition vari-
       able  attributes  object  attr  with  the  default value for all of the
       attributes defined by the implementation.

       Results are undefined if pthread_condattr_init() is  called  specifying
       an already initialized attr attributes object.

       After  a condition variable attributes object has been used to initial-
       ize one  or  more  condition  variables,  any  function  affecting  the
       attributes  object  (including destruction) shall not affect any previ-
       ously initialized condition variables.

       This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 requires two attributes, the  clock
       attribute and the process-shared attribute.

       Additional attributes, their default values, and the names of the asso-
       ciated functions to get and set those attribute values are  implementa-
       tion-defined.

RETURN VALUE
       If   successful,   the   pthread_condattr_destroy()   and  pthread_con-
       dattr_init() functions shall return zero; otherwise,  an  error  number
       shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The pthread_condattr_destroy() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.


       The pthread_condattr_init() function shall fail if:

       ENOMEM Insufficient  memory exists to initialize the condition variable
              attributes object.


       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       See pthread_attr_init() and pthread_mutex_init() .

       A process-shared attribute has been defined for condition variables for
       the same reason it has been defined for mutexes.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
