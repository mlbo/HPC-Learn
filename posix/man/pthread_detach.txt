PTHREAD_DETACH(P)          POSIX Programmer's Manual         PTHREAD_DETACH(P)



NAME
       pthread_detach - detach a thread

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_detach(pthread_t thread);


DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_detach() function shall indicate to the implementation that
       storage for the thread thread can be reclaimed when that thread  termi-
       nates.  If  thread has not terminated, pthread_detach() shall not cause
       it to terminate. The effect of multiple pthread_detach() calls  on  the
       same target thread is unspecified.

RETURN VALUE
       If  the  call  succeeds, pthread_detach() shall return 0; otherwise, an
       error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The pthread_detach() function shall fail if:

       EINVAL The implementation has detected  that  the  value  specified  by
              thread does not refer to a joinable thread.

       ESRCH  No  thread could be found corresponding to that specified by the
              given thread ID.


       The pthread_detach()  function  shall  not  return  an  error  code  of
       [EINTR].

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       The  pthread_join()  or pthread_detach() functions should eventually be
       called for every thread that is created so that storage associated with
       the thread may be reclaimed.

       It  has  been  suggested that a "detach" function is not necessary; the
       detachstate thread creation attribute is  sufficient,  since  a  thread
       need  never  be  dynamically detached. However, need arises in at least
       two cases:

        1. In a cancellation handler for a pthread_join() it is nearly  essen-
           tial  to  have  a  pthread_detach() function in order to detach the
           thread on which pthread_join() was waiting. Without it, it would be
           necessary  to have the handler do another pthread_join() to attempt
           to detach the thread, which would both delay the cancellation  pro-
           cessing  for  an  unbounded  period  and  introduce  a  new call to
           pthread_join(), which might itself need a cancellation  handler.  A
           dynamic detach is nearly essential in this case.


        2. In  order  to  detach  the "initial thread" (as may be desirable in
           processes that set up server threads).


FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
