NAME
       pthread_barrierattr_destroy,  pthread_barrierattr_init  -  destroy  and
       initialize the barrier attributes object (ADVANCED REALTIME THREADS)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_barrierattr_destroy(pthread_barrierattr_t *attr);
       int pthread_barrierattr_init(pthread_barrierattr_t *attr);


DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_barrierattr_destroy()  function  shall  destroy  a  barrier
       attributes object. A destroyed attr attributes object can be reinitial-
       ized using pthread_barrierattr_init(); the results of otherwise  refer-
       encing  the object after it has been destroyed are undefined. An imple-
       mentation may cause pthread_barrierattr_destroy()  to  set  the  object
       referenced by attr to an invalid value.

       The  pthread_barrierattr_init()  function  shall  initialize  a barrier
       attributes object attr with the default value for all of the attributes
       defined by the implementation.

       Results  are undefined if pthread_barrierattr_init() is called specify-
       ing an already initialized attr attributes object.

       After a barrier attributes object has been used to  initialize  one  or
       more  barriers, any function affecting the attributes object (including
       destruction) shall not affect any previously initialized barrier.

RETURN VALUE
       If successful, the pthread_barrierattr_destroy()  and  pthread_barrier-
       attr_init()  functions  shall  return  zero; otherwise, an error number
       shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The pthread_barrierattr_destroy() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.


       The pthread_barrierattr_init() function shall fail if:

       ENOMEM Insufficient memory exists to initialize the barrier  attributes
              object.


       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The  pthread_barrierattr_destroy() and pthread_barrierattr_init() func-
       tions are part of the Barriers option and need not be provided  on  all
       implementations.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
