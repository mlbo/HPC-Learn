NAME
       pthread_attr_getstacksize,  pthread_attr_setstacksize - get and set the
       stacksize attribute

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_attr_getstacksize(const pthread_attr_t *restrict attr,
              size_t *restrict stacksize);
       int pthread_attr_setstacksize(pthread_attr_t *attr, size_t stacksize);


DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_attr_getstacksize() and  pthread_attr_setstacksize()  func-
       tions,  respectively,  shall  get and set the thread creation stacksize
       attribute in the attr object.

       The stacksize attribute shall define the minimum stack size (in  bytes)
       allocated for the created threads stack.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon    successful    completion,    pthread_attr_getstacksize()    and
       pthread_attr_setstacksize() shall return a value of  0;  otherwise,  an
       error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

       The pthread_attr_getstacksize() function stores the stacksize attribute
       value in stacksize if successful.

ERRORS
       The pthread_attr_setstacksize() function shall fail if:

       EINVAL The value of  stacksize  is  less  than  {PTHREAD_STACK_MIN}  or
              exceeds a system-imposed limit.


       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].
