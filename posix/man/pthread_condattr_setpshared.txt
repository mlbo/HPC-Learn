NAME
       pthread_condattr_getpshared,  pthread_condattr_setpshared - get and set
       the process-shared condition variable attributes

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int  pthread_condattr_getpshared(const   pthread_condattr_t   *restrict
       attr,
              int *restrict pshared);
       int pthread_condattr_setpshared(pthread_condattr_t *attr,
              int pshared);


DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_condattr_getpshared()  function  shall obtain the value of
       the process-shared attribute from the attributes object  referenced  by
       attr. The pthread_condattr_setpshared() function shall set the process-
       shared attribute in an  initialized  attributes  object  referenced  by
       attr.

       The process-shared attribute is set to PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED to permit
       a condition variable to be operated upon by any thread that has  access
       to  the  memory  where the condition variable is allocated, even if the
       condition variable is allocated in memory that is  shared  by  multiple
       processes.  If the process-shared attribute is PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE,
       the condition variable shall only be operated upon by  threads  created
       within  the  same  process as the thread that initialized the condition
       variable; if threads of differing processes attempt to operate on  such
       a  condition  variable, the behavior is undefined. The default value of
       the attribute is PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE.

RETURN VALUE
       If successful, the pthread_condattr_setpshared() function shall  return
       zero;  otherwise,  an  error  number  shall be returned to indicate the
       error.

       If successful, the pthread_condattr_getpshared() function shall  return
       zero  and  store the value of the process-shared attribute of attr into
       the object referenced by the pshared  parameter.  Otherwise,  an  error
       number shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The   pthread_condattr_getpshared()  and  pthread_condattr_setpshared()
       functions may fail if:

       EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.


       The pthread_condattr_setpshared() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The new value specified for the attribute is outside  the  range
              of legal values for that attribute.


       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].
