PTHREAD_SELF(P)            POSIX Programmer's Manual           PTHREAD_SELF(P)



NAME
       pthread_self - get the calling thread ID

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       pthread_t pthread_self(void);


DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_self()  function shall return the thread ID of the calling
       thread.

RETURN VALUE
       Refer to the DESCRIPTION.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The pthread_self() function shall not return an error code of  [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       The  pthread_self()  function provides a capability similar to the get-
       pid() function for processes and the rationale is the  same:  the  cre-
       ation call does not provide the thread ID to the created thread.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
