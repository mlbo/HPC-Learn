MPI_Waitany(3)                        MPI                       MPI_Waitany(3)



NAME
       MPI_Waitany -  Waits for any specified send or receive to complete

SYNOPSIS
       #include "mpi.h"
       int MPI_Waitany(
               int count,
               MPI_Request array_of_requests[],
               int *index,
               MPI_Status *status )

INPUT PARAMETERS
       count  - list length (integer)
       array_of_requests
              - array of requests (array of handles)


OUTPUT PARAMETERS
       index  -  index  of  handle for operation that completed (integer).  In
              the range 0 to count-1 .  In Fortran, the range is 1 to count  .

       status - status object (Status).  May be MPI_STATUS_IGNORE .



NOTES
       If all of the requests are MPI_REQUEST_NULL , then index is returned as
       MPI_UNDEFINED , and status is returned as an empty status.


NOTE ON STATUS FOR SEND OPERATIONS
       For send operations, the only use of status is  for  MPI_Test_cancelled
       or  in  the  case  that  there is an error, in which case the MPI_ERROR
       field of status will be set.


NOTES FOR FORTRAN
       All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK )  have
       an  additional  argument ierr at the end of the argument list.  ierr is
       an integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the  routine
       in  C.   In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with
       the call statement.

       All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype , MPI_Comm ) are of type INTEGER in
       Fortran.


ERRORS
       All  MPI  routines  (except  MPI_Wtime  and MPI_Wtick ) return an error
       value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines  in
       the last argument.  Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
       handler is called.  By default, this error handler aborts the MPI  job.
       The  error  handler may be changed with MPI_Errhandler_set ; the prede-
       fined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error values
       to  be  returned.  Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program
       can continue past an error.

       MPI_SUCCESS
              - No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
       MPI_ERR_REQUEST
              - Invalid MPI_Request .  Either  null  or,  in  the  case  of  a
              MPI_Start or MPI_Startall , not a persistent request.
       MPI_ERR_ARG
              - Invalid argument.  Some argument is invalid and is not identi-
              fied by a specific error class (e.g., MPI_ERR_RANK ).
