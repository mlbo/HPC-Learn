MPI_Group_range_incl(3)               MPI              MPI_Group_range_incl(3)



NAME
       MPI_Group_range_incl  -  Creates a new group from ranges of ranks in an
       existing group

SYNOPSIS
       #include "mpi.h"
       int MPI_Group_range_incl ( MPI_Group group, int n, int ranges[][3],
                                MPI_Group *newgroup )

INPUT PARAMETERS
       group  - group (handle)
       n      - number of triplets in array ranges (integer)
       ranges - a one-dimensional array  of  integer  triplets,  of  the  form
              (first  rank,  last  rank,  stride) indicating ranks in group or
              processes to be included in newgroup



OUTPUT PARAMETER
       newgroup
              - new group derived from above, in the order defined  by  ranges
              (handle)


NOTE
       This  implementation  does  not currently check to see that the list of
       ranges to include are valid ranks in the group.


NOTES FOR FORTRAN
       All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK )  have
       an  additional  argument ierr at the end of the argument list.  ierr is
       an integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the  routine
       in  C.   In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with
       the call statement.

       All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype , MPI_Comm ) are of type INTEGER in
       Fortran.


ERRORS
       All  MPI  routines  (except  MPI_Wtime  and MPI_Wtick ) return an error
       value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines  in
       the last argument.  Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
       handler is called.  By default, this error handler aborts the MPI  job.
       The  error  handler may be changed with MPI_Errhandler_set ; the prede-
       fined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error values
       to  be  returned.  Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program
       can continue past an error.

       MPI_SUCCESS
              - No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
       MPI_ERR_GROUP
              - Null group passed to function.
       MPI_ERR_INTERN
              - This error is returned when some part of the MPICH implementa-
              tion is unable to acquire memory.
       MPI_ERR_ARG
              - Invalid argument.  Some argument is invalid and is not identi-
              fied by a specific error class (e.g., MPI_ERR_RANK ).
       MPI_ERR_RANK
              - Invalid source or destination rank.   Ranks  must  be  between
              zero  and  the  size  of  the communicator minus one; ranks in a
              receive ( MPI_Recv , MPI_Irecv , MPI_Sendrecv , etc.)  may  also
              be MPI_ANY_SOURCE .
