MPI_Group_range_excl(3)               MPI              MPI_Group_range_excl(3)



NAME
       MPI_Group_range_excl  -   Produces  a group by excluding ranges of pro-
       cesses from an existing group

SYNOPSIS
       #include "mpi.h"
       int MPI_Group_range_excl ( MPI_Group group, int n, int ranges[][3],
                                MPI_Group *newgroup )

INPUT PARAMETERS
       group  - group (handle)
       n      - number of elements in array ranks (integer)
       ranges - a one-dimensional array of integer triplets of the form (first
              rank,  last rank, stride), indicating the ranks in group of pro-
              cesses to be excluded from the output group newgroup .



OUTPUT PARAMETER
       newgroup
              - new group derived from above, preserving the  order  in  group
              (handle)


NOTE
       Currently,  each  of  the  ranks to exclude must be a valid rank in the
       group and all elements must be distinct or the function  is  erroneous.
       This restriction is per the draft.


NOTES FOR FORTRAN
       All  MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK ) have
       an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list.   ierr  is
       an  integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine
       in C.  In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are  invoked  with
       the call statement.

       All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype , MPI_Comm ) are of type INTEGER in
       Fortran.


ERRORS
       All MPI routines (except MPI_Wtime and  MPI_Wtick  )  return  an  error
       value;  C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in
       the last argument.  Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
       handler  is called.  By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.
       The error handler may be changed with MPI_Errhandler_set ;  the  prede-
       fined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error values
       to be returned.  Note that MPI does not guarantee that an  MPI  program
       can continue past an error.

       MPI_SUCCESS
              - No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
       MPI_ERR_GROUP
              - Null group passed to function.
       MPI_ERR_INTERN
              - This error is returned when some part of the MPICH implementa-
              tion is unable to acquire memory.
       MPI_ERR_RANK
              - Invalid source or destination rank.   Ranks  must  be  between
              zero  and  the  size  of  the communicator minus one; ranks in a
              receive ( MPI_Recv , MPI_Irecv , MPI_Sendrecv , etc.)  may  also
              be MPI_ANY_SOURCE .

       MPI_ERR_ARG
              - Invalid argument.  Some argument is invalid and is not identi-
              fied by a specific error class (e.g., MPI_ERR_RANK ).
