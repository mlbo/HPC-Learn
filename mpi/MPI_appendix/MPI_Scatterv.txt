MPI_Scatterv(3)                       MPI                      MPI_Scatterv(3)



NAME
       MPI_Scatterv -  Scatters a buffer in parts to all tasks in a group

SYNOPSIS
       #include "mpi.h"
       int MPI_Scatterv (
               void *sendbuf,
               int *sendcnts,
               int *displs,
               MPI_Datatype sendtype,
               void *recvbuf,
               int recvcnt,
               MPI_Datatype recvtype,
               int root,
               MPI_Comm comm )

INPUT PARAMETERS
       sendbuf
              - address of send buffer (choice, significant only at root )
       sendcounts
              -  integer array (of length group size) specifying the number of
              elements to send to each processor
       displs - integer array (of length group size). Entry  i  specifies  the
              displacement (relative to sendbuf  from which to take the outgo-
              ing data to process i

       sendtype
              - data type of send buffer elements (handle)
       recvcount
              - number of elements in receive buffer (integer)
       recvtype
              - data type of receive buffer elements (handle)
       root   - rank of sending process (integer)
       comm   - communicator (handle)


OUTPUT PARAMETER
       recvbuf
              - address of receive buffer (choice)


NOTES FOR FORTRAN
       All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK )  have
       an  additional  argument ierr at the end of the argument list.  ierr is
       an integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the  routine
       in  C.   In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with
       the call statement.

       All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype , MPI_Comm ) are of type INTEGER in
       Fortran.


ERRORS
       All  MPI  routines  (except  MPI_Wtime  and MPI_Wtick ) return an error
       value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines  in
       the last argument.  Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
       handler is called.  By default, this error handler aborts the MPI  job.
       The  error  handler may be changed with MPI_Errhandler_set ; the prede-
       fined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error values
       to  be  returned.  Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program
       can continue past an error.

       MPI_SUCCESS
              - No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
       MPI_ERR_COMM
              - Invalid communicator.  A common error is to use a null  commu-
              nicator in a call (not even allowed in MPI_Comm_rank ).
       MPI_ERR_COUNT
              - Invalid count argument.  Count arguments must be non-negative;
              a count of zero is often valid.
       MPI_ERR_TYPE
              - Invalid datatype argument.  May be an uncommitted MPI_Datatype
              (see MPI_Type_commit ).
       MPI_ERR_BUFFER
              -  Invalid  buffer  pointer.  Usually a null buffer where one is
              not valid.
