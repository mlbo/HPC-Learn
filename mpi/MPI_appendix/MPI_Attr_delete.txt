MPI_Attr_delete(3)                    MPI                   MPI_Attr_delete(3)



NAME
       MPI_Attr_delete -  Deletes attribute value associated with a key

SYNOPSIS
       #include "mpi.h"
       int MPI_Attr_delete ( MPI_Comm comm, int keyval )

INPUT PARAMETERS
       comm   - communicator to which attribute is attached (handle)
       keyval - The key value of the deleted attribute (integer)


NOTES FOR FORTRAN
       All  MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK ) have
       an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list.   ierr  is
       an  integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine
       in C.  In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are  invoked  with
       the call statement.

       All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype , MPI_Comm ) are of type INTEGER in
       Fortran.


ERRORS
       All MPI routines (except MPI_Wtime and  MPI_Wtick  )  return  an  error
       value;  C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in
       the last argument.  Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
       handler  is called.  By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.
       The error handler may be changed with MPI_Errhandler_set ;  the  prede-
       fined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error values
       to be returned.  Note that MPI does not guarantee that an  MPI  program
       can continue past an error.

       MPI_ERR_COMM
              -  Invalid communicator.  A common error is to use a null commu-
              nicator in a call (not even allowed in MPI_Comm_rank ).
       MPI_ERR_ARG
              - This error class is associated with an error code  that  indi-
              cates  that  an  attempt  was  made to free one of the permanent
              keys.
