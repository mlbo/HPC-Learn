MPI_Op_free(3)                        MPI                       MPI_Op_free(3)



NAME
       MPI_Op_free -  Frees a user-defined combination function handle

SYNOPSIS
       #include "mpi.h"
       int MPI_Op_free( MPI_Op *op )

INPUT PARAMETER
       op     - operation (handle)


NOTES
       op is set to MPI_OP_NULL on exit.


NULL HANDLES
       The MPI 1.1 specification, in the section on opaque objects, explicitly

DISALLOWS FREEING A NULL COMMUNICATOR. THE TEXT FROM THE STANDARD IS
       A null handle argument is an erroneous IN argument in MPI calls, unless an
       exception is explicitly stated in the text that defines the function. Such
       exception is allowed for handles to request objects in Wait and Test calls
       (sections Communication Completion and Multiple Completions ). Otherwise, a
       null handle can only be passed to a function that allocates a new object and
       returns a reference to it in the handle.



NOTES FOR FORTRAN
       All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK )  have
       an  additional  argument ierr at the end of the argument list.  ierr is
       an integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the  routine
       in  C.   In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with
       the call statement.

       All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype , MPI_Comm ) are of type INTEGER in
       Fortran.


ERRORS
       All  MPI  routines  (except  MPI_Wtime  and MPI_Wtick ) return an error
       value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines  in
       the last argument.  Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
       handler is called.  By default, this error handler aborts the MPI  job.
       The  error  handler may be changed with MPI_Errhandler_set ; the prede-
       fined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error values
       to  be  returned.  Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program
       can continue past an error.

       MPI_SUCCESS
              - No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
       MPI_ERR_ARG
              - Invalid argument.  Some argument is invalid and is not identi-
              fied by a specific error class (e.g., MPI_ERR_RANK ).
       MPI_ERR_ARG
              -  Invalid  argument;  the error code associated with this error
              indicates an attempt to free an MPI permanent  operation  (e.g.,
              MPI_SUM ).  *N/ /*N MPI_ERR_PERM_KEY
       MPI_ERR_ARG
              -  Invalid  argument;  the error code associated with this error
              indicates an attempt to free or change an MPI  permanent  keyval
              (e.g., MPI_TAG_UB ).  *N/ /*N MPI_ERR_UNKNOWN
       MPI_ERR_UNKNOWN
              -  Unknown error.  You should never see this.  If you do, report
              it to mpi-bugs@mcs.anl.gov .
