MPI_Get_count(3)                      MPI                     MPI_Get_count(3)



NAME
       MPI_Get_count -  Gets the number of "top level" elements

SYNOPSIS
       #include "mpi.h"
       int MPI_Get_count(
               MPI_Status *status,
               MPI_Datatype datatype,
               int *count )

INPUT PARAMETERS
       status - return status of receive operation (Status)
       datatype
              - datatype of each receive buffer element (handle)


OUTPUT PARAMETER
       count  -  number  of  received elements (integer) Notes: If the size of
              the datatype is zero, this routine will return a count of  zero.
              If  the amount of data in status is not an exact multiple of the
              size of datatype (so that count would not be integral), a  count
              of MPI_UNDEFINED is returned instead.


NOTES FOR FORTRAN
       All  MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK ) have
       an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list.   ierr  is
       an  integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine
       in C.  In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are  invoked  with
       the call statement.

       All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype , MPI_Comm ) are of type INTEGER in
       Fortran.


ERRORS
       All MPI routines (except MPI_Wtime and  MPI_Wtick  )  return  an  error
       value;  C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in
       the last argument.  Before the value is returned, the current MPI error
       handler  is called.  By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.
       The error handler may be changed with MPI_Errhandler_set ;  the  prede-
       fined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error values
       to be returned.  Note that MPI does not guarantee that an  MPI  program
       can continue past an error.

       MPI_SUCCESS
              - No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
       MPI_ERR_TYPE
              - Invalid datatype argument.  May be an uncommitted MPI_Datatype
              (see MPI_Type_commit ).
