OpenMP is an Application Program Interface (API), jointly defined by a group of major computer hardware and software vendors. OpenMP provides a portable, scalable model for developers of shared memory parallel applications. The API supports C/C++ and Fortran on a wide variety of architectures. This tutorial covers most of the major features of OpenMP 3.1, including its various constructs and directives for specifying parallel regions, work sharing, synchronization and data environment. Runtime library functions and environment variables are also covered. This tutorial includes both C and Fortran example codes and a lab exercise.

*Level/Prerequisites:* This tutorial is one of the eight tutorials in the 4+ day "Using LLNL's Supercomputers" workshop. It is geared to those who are new to parallel programming with OpenMP. Basic understanding of parallel programming in C or Fortran is required. For those who are unfamiliar with Parallel Programming in general, the material covered in [EC3500: Introduction to Parallel Computing](https://hpc.llnl.gov/training/tutorials/introduction-parallel-computing-tutorial) would be helpful.
